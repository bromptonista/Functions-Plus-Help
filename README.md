# Functions-Plus-Help
The help document that I've created for the LUA script "Functions+". This script is only applicable to jailbroken iOS devices that have the jailbreak tweak **AutoTouch; it adds 30+ new functions ranging from additional color converters, the ability to pretty print tables, edits to specified files, and many other useful functions!

**AutoTouch is a macro tool for iDevices that can record/playback touches and button presses. As the app uses LUA to write the recorded scripts, users can go in and write their own code. AutoTouch also supplies many different functions to get/find pixel colors, take screenshots, open/close apps, and more. The formal help document can be found [here](https://autotouch.net/server/doc/en.html). Kent Krantz is creator and owner of AutoTouch.
